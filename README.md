# C-SquareRoot
Various algorithms to find the square root of a number


# Algorithms

- [Basic Greedy Approach](https://github.com/dyingg/C-SquareRoot/blob/master/est-1.c)

Time : O(n)  
Accuracy: Terrible(Only perfect square support)


- [Babylonian Approximation Technique - Naive](https://github.com/dyingg/C-SquareRoot/blob/master/babylonian-naive.c)

Time : ??  
Accuracy : Mild ( Correct to 2 decimals accuracy restricted +- 0.5)
